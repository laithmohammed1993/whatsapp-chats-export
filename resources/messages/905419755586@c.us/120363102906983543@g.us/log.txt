Whilst this was bad enough, I then had to prompt her whilst she was doing 105mph and scrolling on her mobile phone. \n\nI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll agree, this is absolutely unacceptable and totally unsafe. \n\nThe reason for the delayed email is due to having the wrong email (info@apcars.com) but I bring this to your attention because this is clearly normalised behaviour for her and I worry about how she is compromising your duty of care to customers.\n\"\nWioleta - 842919",
